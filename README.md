## UI Prototype

## Getting Started
The easiest way to test the app and see the work in progress is using Android Studio. Android studio is a development environment that includes an emulator which you can use to simulate an Android device on your computer, as well as tools for running the app on your physical Android device, if you'd prefer.

### Android Studio
Install the latest version of Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/

In the **Welcome to Android Studio** window, click **Get from Version Control**

## Running the App
### Running on a Physical Device (Recommended)
TODO: RUN ON MY OWN PHONE TO FIGURE IT OUT
### Running on an Emulator
Note: Creating a Virtual Device in order to run the emulator can take upwards of 9GB of storage space. If this space is not available, try [running on a physical device](#running-on-a-physical-device) instead.

### Create a Virtual Device
A Virtual Device contains all of the information that the emulator needs to simulate an Android device. 
In Android Studio, click **Tools > AVD Manager**

Click **Create Virtual Device...**  
![AVD Manager Screen](https://github.com/joshdickie/NDIS-support-app/doobledeedoo)  
The **Select Hardware** page opens.

Select the device you would like to create an image of. Any device is fine - If you own an Android device, feel free to select the definition that matches it. If you're not sure, select **Pixel 4**.

Click **Next**

The **System Image** page opens.

Select an image from the **Recommended** tab. If you're not sure, select **Q**. If you see **Download** next to your selected image, you will need to click it in order to download the image.

The **Verify Configuration** page opens.

Click **Finish**.

### Start the Emulator
With a [Virtual Device](#create-a-virtual-device) created, select it in the target device drop-down menu.  
![Selecting Target Device](https://github.com/joshdickie/NDIS-support-app/doobledeedoo)

Click **Run** ![Run Button](https://github.com/joshdickie/NDIS-support-app/doobledeedoo)

Android Studio will start the emulator and install the app. It should open the app automatically.
